title: ColorPanel Project Started
---

<p>ColorPanel is a new project that I intend to build over the next months. The hardware is simple. It&#8217;s an 50cmx50cm picture frame, lit up by WS2812b <span class="caps">LED</span> strips. The LEDs are controlled by a <a href="//hotwolf.github.io/S12G-Micro-EVB">S12G-Micro-<span class="caps">EVB</span></a> board, running <a href="//hotwolf.github.io/S12CForth">S12CForth</a>.</p>
