title: Cut the LED Strips, Don't Unsolder Them
---

<p>All of my WS2812B <span class="caps">LED</span> stips came in segments of 50cm which were soldered together.</p>

<p>Since this is exactly the length I need, I decided to unsolder them. After struggling with a<br />
soldering iron for a bit, I started using a hot air gun. This worked fine on one manufacturers<br />
<span class="caps">LED</span> strips. When I switched to the <span class="caps">LED</span> strips from another manufacturer, I ended up<br />
unsoldering LEDs along with the joints.</p>

<p>This is not a problem because I can just solder them back in. But there were tiny 402 size bypass<br />
caps next to the LEDs which are now lost forever. <br />
Next time I will just cut the strips and leave those joints alone.</p>
