title: Cut the LED Strips, Don't Unsolder Them
---

All of my WS2812B LED stips came in segments of 50cm which were soldered together.

Since this is exactly the length I need, I decided to unsolder them. After struggling with a
soldering iron for a bit, I started using a hot air gun. This worked fine on one manufacturers
LED strips. When I switched to the LED strips from another manufacturer, I ended up
unsoldering LEDs along with the joints.

This is not a problem because I can just solder them back in. But there were tiny 402 size bypass
caps next to the LEDs which are now lost forever. 
Next time I will just cut the strips and leave those joints alone.
